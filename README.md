Game Mechanics

    Targets: New targets appear at random intervals. They grow to a maximum size and then shrink until they disappear.
    Scoring: Each successful click on a target counts as a hit. Missing a target or allowing it to disappear counts as a miss.
    Lives: The game ends when the number of misses reaches the maximum allowed lives.
